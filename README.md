# All Jumbled up
During my development bootcamp, a few people were struggling at the beginning of the course to distinguish between the languages, frameworks, and concepts we were using. A way to solidify their knowledge, I thought, would to be to create a fun game which used these languages and frameworks as the solutions to a word that had the letters randomised (All Jumbled Up!) the game includes hints if needed, which would reaffirm the knowledge of the player.

In this project, I had to deal with basic conditional rendering using CSS display properties as well as JavaScript to manipulate the CSS.
Overall, this project helped to develop my knowledge of JavaScript, which has greatly helped with my own progression as a developer, greatly aiding my proficiency in React and Angular. 
I really enjoy making games, and will look to make more in the future.
